            <strong>Why We Use Your Information</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We use your personal information only when we have a legal reason to
            do so. Here are the main reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your Consent: In some cases, you&apos;ll give us your explicit
              consent to use your information for a specific purpose, like
              subscribing to a newsletter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fulfilling a Contract: We may use your data to deliver services
              you&apos;ve requested, like providing reports you&apos;ve
              purchased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legitimate Interests: We may also use your information for our
              legitimate business interests, but only when these interests
              don&apos;t conflict with your privacy rights. This could include
              using your data to improve our website or services, prevent fraud,
              or provide you with relevant offers. We balance these interests
              carefully and won&apos;t use your data if the impact on your
              privacy is too great.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>
            <strong>Marketing Communications</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We use your contact details to send marketing messages only when
            you&apos;ve explicitly agreed to receive them (consumers) or
            haven&apos;t opted out (businesses and others who have requested
            information, subscribed, or provided contact details through a third
            party).{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You can easily unsubscribe from marketing messages at any time by
            contacting us or clicking the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; button in an
            email. Please note that opting out won&apos;t affect information
            related to existing service agreements.
          </p>
          <h5>
            <strong>Change of Purpose</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We typically use your personal data only for the reasons we
            originally collected it. However, there may be situations where we
            need to use it for a different but compatible purpose. For example,
            using your contact details to send you relevant information about
            our services, even if you initially signed up for a newsletter.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the new purpose is unrelated to the original reason, we&apos;ll
            clearly explain this to you and outline the legal justification that
            allows us to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some rare cases, the law may permit us to use your data without
            your knowledge or consent. We&apos;ll only do this in strict
            accordance with legal requirements.
          </p>
          <h5>
            <strong>Disclosures of your personal data</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out
            below for the purposes set out in paragraph 4 above.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any of our third party clients or partners for the purposes of

            specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

            <strong>International Transfers</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Since some of our third-party service providers or partners might
            operate outside India, your personal data may be transferred
            internationally during processing. Whenever this happens, we ensure
            a similar level of protection as mandated by the Indian data
            protection laws. Here&apos;s how we achieve this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Transfer to Approved Countries:</strong> We only transfer
              data to countries deemed to have adequate data protection
              safeguards by the Indian government.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong> We utilize specific
              contracts approved by the Indian authorities that guarantee your
              data receives the same level of protection it has in India.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent:</strong> In some cases, we may seek your explicit
              consent before transferring your data outside India.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We can provide more details on the specific mechanisms used for
            international data transfers upon request.

            <strong>Data Security</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We take data security seriously and have implemented robust security
            measures to prevent:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accidental loss of your personal data.</li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These measures involve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Restricting access to your data to authorized personnel with a
              legitimate business need.
            </li>
            <li>
              Requiring all personnel handling your data to follow strict
              confidentiality protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having procedures in place to identify and address any potential
              data breaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notifying you and the relevant authorities of a data breach (if
              legally required).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>
            <strong>Data retention</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            We will only keep your personal data for as long as it&apos;s needed
            to fulfill the reason, we collected it. This includes any legal,
            accounting, or reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            We consider several factors to determine the appropriate retention
            period for your data, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The type of data and its sensitivity</li>
            <li>Legal requirements</li>
            <li>The risk of unauthorized access or misuse</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            types of data, please contact us.

          <p>

            <strong>Glossary</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            <strong>“Personal data”</strong>, or
            <strong>“personal information”</strong>, means any information about
            an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not
            include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>“Sensitive Personal Data”</strong> means information
            revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
            similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health
            conditions, sexual life, sexual orientation, biometric or genetic
            data, and personal data relating to criminal offences and
            convictions.

            <strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
            <strong>“Legitimate interest”</strong> means the interest of our
            business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to
            give you the best service and the best and most secure experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you
            (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your
            personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
            personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by
            the privacy impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
            otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further
            information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any
            potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by
            contacting us. <strong>“Performance of contract”</strong> means
            processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request
            before entering into such a contract. <br />
            <strong>“Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation”</strong>
            means processing your personal data where it is necessary for
            compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject
            to.
          </p>
          <h5>
            <strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
          </h5>
          <p>You have the right to:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly
            known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to
            receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check
            that we are lawfully processing it.
            <br />
            <strong>Request correction of the personal data</strong> that we
            hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
            inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
            verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
            <br />
            <strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This enables
            you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no
            good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
            to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
            successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
            below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
            where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with
            local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
            with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will
            be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
            <br />
            <strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong> where we
            are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
            there is something about your particular situation which makes you
            want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
            on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
            object where we are processing your personal data for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
            override your rights and freedoms. <br />
            <strong>
              Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
            </strong>
            This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
            personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
            establish the data&apos;s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
            unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us
            to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
            establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected
            to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
            overriding legitimate grounds to use it. <br />
            <strong>Request the transfer of your personal data</strong> to you
            or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you
            have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
            automated information which you initially provided consent for us to
            use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
            <br />
            <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying
            on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not
            affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
            withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
            able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this
            is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
